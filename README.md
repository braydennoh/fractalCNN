**Determining a 3D Parameter (Fractal Dimension) from 2D Images (Floc Images)**
How can the fractal dimension, a fundamental 3D geometric property, be accurately inferred from 2D projections of flocs? This challenge highlights the inherent loss of information when transitioning from higher-dimensional data to lower-dimensional representations.
